# Sandwich Shop

This is a simple Flutter app that allows users to order sandwiches.
The app is built using Flutter and Dart, and it is designed primarily to be run in a web
browser.

## Install the essential tools

1. **Terminal**:

    - **macOS** – use the built-in Terminal app by pressing **⌘ + Space**, typing **Terminal**, and pressing **Return**.
    - **Windows** – open the start menu using the **Windows** key. Then enter **cmd** to open the **Command Prompt**. Alternatively, you can use **Windows PowerShell** or **Windows Terminal**.

2. **Git** – verify that you have `git` installed by entering `git --version`, in the terminal.
    If this is missing, download the installer from [Git's official site](https://git-scm.com/downloads?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

3. **Package managers**:

    - **Homebrew** (macOS) – verify that you have `brew` installed with `brew --version`; if missing, follow the instructions on the [Homebrew installation page](https://brew.sh/).
    - **Chocolatey** (Windows) – verify that you have `choco` installed with `choco --version`; if missing, follow the instructions on the [Chocolatey installation page](https://chocolatey.org/install).

4. **Flutter SDK** – verify that you have `flutter` installed and it is working with `flutter doctor`; if missing, install it using your package manager:

    - **macOS**: `brew install --cask flutter`
    - **Windows**: `choco install flutter`

5. **Visual Studio Code** – verify that you have `code` installed with `code --version`; if missing, use your package manager to install it:

    - **macOS**: `brew install --cask visual-studio-code`
    - **Windows**: `choco install vscode`

## Get the code

### If this is your first time working on this project

Enter the following commands in your terminal to clone the repository and
open it in Visual Studio Code.
You may want to change directory (`cd`) to the directory where you want to clone the
repository first.

```bash
git clone --branch 8 https://github.com/manighahrmani/sandwich_shop
cd sandwich_shop
code .
```

### If you have already cloned the repository

Enter the following commands in your terminal to switch to the correct branch.
Remember to `cd` to the directory where you cloned the repository first.

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout 8
```

## Run the app

Open the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code by first opening the Command
Palette with **⌘ + Shift + P** (macOS) or **Ctrl + Shift + P** (Windows) and
typing **Terminal: Create New Terminal** then pressing **Enter**.

In the terminal, run the following commands to install the dependencies and run
the app in your web browser:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Tests

- Integration: [integration_test/app_test.dart](integration_test/app_test.dart)
    - Unit/widget suites live under [test/](test):
        - [test/models](test/models) – cart, sandwich, saved order
        - [test/repositories](test/repositories) – pricing repository
        - [test/services](test/services) – database service
        - [test/views](test/views) – order, cart, checkout, order history, profile, settings screens
        - [test/widgets](test/widgets) – common widgets
        - [test/widget_test.dart](test/widget_test.dart)

Run integration tests (desktop/web device selection required):

```bash
flutter test integration_test/app_test.dart
```

Run unit/widget tests:

```bash
flutter test test
```

## Build

- Web release (recommended for size baseline):
    ```bash
    flutter build web --release
    ```
- Windows desktop release:
    ```bash
    flutter build windows --release
    ```
- Debug builds are produced by `flutter run` (hot reload, larger size).

Device selection: integration tests prompt for a target. Choose `1` for Windows desktop or `2` for Chrome when prompted.

## Build Artifact Sizes

- Release build artifact (current baseline): 89 KB
- Debug build artifact (current baseline): 1,003 KB

Notes:
- Release builds are smaller because code is tree-shaken, minified, and stripped of debug symbols.
- Debug builds include additional metadata and service code (hot reload, asserts, diagnostics), so they are larger.
